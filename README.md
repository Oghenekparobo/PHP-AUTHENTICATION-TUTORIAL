# About This Repository
This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding PHP authentication and database interaction. It contains code examples and demonstrations intended for educational purposes.

## Why .env File and Vendor Folder Are Included

### .env File Visibility
The inclusion of the `.env` file in this repository is solely for learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, it is a common best practice to keep sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, confidential by excluding them from version control. However, for educational purposes, exposing the `.env` file allows learners to understand how environment variables are used to configure applications.

### Vendor Folder Inclusion
Similarly, including the `vendor` folder, which contains Composer dependencies, is for educational purposes only. In practice, it is recommended to exclude the `vendor` folder from version control to keep repository sizes manageable and to avoid sharing unnecessary code. However, including it in this repository simplifies the setup process for learners by providing all necessary dependencies upfront.

## Repository Contents
- **Source Code**: Contains PHP files illustrating authentication mechanisms, database interactions, and error handling.
- **README**: Provides essential information about the repository, including usage instructions and guidelines.
- **.env File**: Includes environment variables necessary for configuring the application environment.
- **Vendor Folder**: Contains third-party dependencies managed by Composer.

## Note on Security
While exposing sensitive information and large files in a repository is acceptable for educational purposes, it is crucial to emphasize that this practice should never be replicated in personal or official projects. Exposing sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other confidential data, poses significant security risks and can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

Always follow best practices and safe coding principles when working on real-world projects. This includes keeping sensitive information secure, adhering to version control best practices, and regularly reviewing and updating security measures to protect against potential threats.

By adhering to best practices and exercising caution, we can ensure the security and integrity of our projects while leveraging valuable learning opportunities provided by repositories like this one.
